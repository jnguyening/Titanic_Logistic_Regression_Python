# Titanic Survival Prediction Using Logistic Regression (Python)

This repository contains a Python-based machine learning project that uses **logistic regression** to predict passenger survival on the Titanic. The analysis is based on the classic [Kaggle Titanic dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/titanic), a common beginner-friendly dataset used to introduce supervised classification models.
